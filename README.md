This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Please run project using npm.

In the project directory, please run "npm install" and then "npm run start".
In the src/css/custom.scss file, you can see @import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
